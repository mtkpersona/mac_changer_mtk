# MAC Address Changer - The Sneaky Switcheroo

Welcome to the MAC Address Changer, a Python script that lets you play hide-and-seek with your network interface's identity. With just a few command-line tricks, you can transform your device into a master of disguise!

## Prerequisites

- Python must be installed on your system.
- Prepare yourself for the cloak-and-dagger operation.

## Usage

```
$ python mac_changer.py -i <interface> -m <new_mac>
```

Replace `<interface>` with the name of the network interface you want to give a new identity (e.g., eth0, wlan0), and `<new_mac>` with the desired MAC address you want to assign.

## Options

The following options are at your service:

- `-i, --interface`: Choose the network interface you wish to perform the switcheroo on.
- `-m, --mac`: Assign the new MAC address to your sneaky interface.

## Example

To give the `eth0` interface a new secret identity as `00:11:22:33:44:55`, execute the following command:

```
$ python mac_changer.py -i eth0 -m 00:11:22:33:44:55
```
